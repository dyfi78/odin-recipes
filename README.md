In this project I created a Recipes home page that links to three different recipe pages.
The index page lists the three recipes as links
Clicking the links directs you to that recipe's webpage
Here you can see the name of the recipe, a photo, a list of ingredients, and the numbered steps to make it
A Home button is at the bottom of the page and returns you to the index page.
