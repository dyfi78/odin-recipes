    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Lasagna meets the green pepper to deliver a taste sure to please the taste buds.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup spaghetti sauce with mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup grated mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high to maintain a rolling simmer. Cook peppers until starting to get soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, sausage, and onion. Cook and stir, breaking up the beef, until onion is soft and meat has lost all its pink color, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Mix spaghetti sauce, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and cooked rice into the beef mixture. Divide among 4 bell peppers and transfer peppers to a baking dish. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese on top of the peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and begins to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
